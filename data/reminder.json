  "team": "Hello there Trainer! My name is *Professor Oak*. I am a custom Discord bot that can help you along your journey! Based on my data, I've noticed that you havn't set your team yet in **Pokemon GO West GA**. This is preventing you from being able to set your location, which allows you to see valuable resources and channels such as the Raids, Sightings and Quests.\nTo set your team, I need you to go to the **set-team** channel and use your team command, **!oak mystic** or **!oak valor** or **!oak instinct**. Once you've done this, I'll reply back to confirm and tell you how to set your location. Happy hunting, Trainer!",
