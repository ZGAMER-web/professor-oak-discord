  "team": "Hello there Trainer! My name is *Professor Oak*. Based on my data, I noticed that you havn't set your team yet on the **Pokemon GO West GA** Discord server. This is preventing you from being able to set your location, which allows you to see valuable resources and channels such as the Raids, Sightings and Quests. Use your teams command *found below* in the **Set-Team** channel under __Set Up__ to set your team. Once you've done this, I will respond and confirm that I've set your team. I'll also tell you how to set your location.\n **!oak mystic**\n**!oak instinct**\n**!oak valor**"
